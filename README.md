# How to use
uhhhhhhh.... soon(tm)
if you can figure out how to install python and the dependencies then you should be able to figure out how to use this, just need to edit these two variables
```
disposablePath = '/Volumes/320G/disposable'
outputPath = '/Volumes/320G/YouTubeRip'
```
If you want unlisted video and all that good stuff then you need to login into PyTube and you might need to modify PyTube code (Blame YouTube?) (How to do that is coming soon(tm) or just read [this](https://pytube.io/en/latest/user/quickstart.html))

# Disclaimer 
I made this for myself back in 2021 for fun and to learn Python. Although there are a lot of shortcomings, IF setup properly, it should work like a charm
